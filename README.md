## General info

The project is a Unsplash copy where you can search for photos (as much as the API allows).
In addition, you can switch between light and dark modes.

## Technologies

- Software language: JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
- React - React Hooks, React query, Axios.
- Unsplash API.

## Features

- Search for Images
- Support for Dark and Light Modes
- The site remembers the mode(dark or light) you choose, and on your first use, it will automatically switch to Dark or Light mode based on your operating system's preference.

## Setup

To run Unsplash Images you need:

- npm modules i used.
- Unsplash API keys.

### How to start?

This project was created with VITE, so all you need is to run `npm i` then create a `.env` file in the root and add there your key like that: `VITE_API_KEY = <API_KEY_HERE>`.
After that, run `npm run dev` in the project directory.
Finally, the site runs in the development mode, open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in your browser.
